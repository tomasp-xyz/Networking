I've finally decided to setup a proper website for myself so that I could publish all of the learning experiences, analysis and any other content that I would like to share with anyone. Oh, and this will serve as an archive for my own ramblings, because I'm surely going to need a place to look at something I've done in the past, but can't quite remember the thought process during some sort of configuration process (just as an example).

P.S. Apparently, it's quite easy to setup a basic website using github pages :)
