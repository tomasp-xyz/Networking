Hi, welcome to this page. It is dedicated solely for write ups of my learning experiences, regardless of the fact whether I'm trying out new technologies or analyzing a type of issue which I found rather interesting (and wanted to know not only how but also _why_ things work). 

In other words, I'm simply documenting my own thought process here "out loud" while trying to learn or solidify knowledge in a specific area of computer networking :).
